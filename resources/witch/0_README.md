# The resources/witch directory

Inside this directory should reside a file `witch_prefpane.zip`, which is a .zip of `Witch.prefPane`, 
corresponding to the most-recent version of Witch for which I’m licensed.

I’m installing from the locally stored .zip, rather than linking to a binary hosted by Many Tricks
because, as of February 16, 2026, Many Tricks has a link to this version labeled only as “latest” 
rather than explicitly to v.4.70. If I were to link to “latest,” I could find myself in the position
that I would have downloaded and installed a newer version for which I’m not licensed.

This way, if a new version is released for which I’m not licensed, I can secure an upgrade license
for that new version *before* updating the source link here.
