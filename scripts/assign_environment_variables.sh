# Establishes values for certain environment variables to ensure compatibility across scripts.
#
# This script is assumed to reside in the same directory as the helpers.sh script of helper functions.
#
# This script is applicable to at least the GenoMac and GenoMac-bootstrap repositories. It may also be
# applicable to the GenoMac-dotfiles repository.
# Thus, ultimately this script, along with helpers.sh, might be relocated into a git submodule.

# Resolve directory of the current script
# Explanation
#	‚Ä¢	(%):-%N:                 Path of the current script, even when sourced.
#	  ‚Ä¢	%N                     The filename of the current script.
#	  ‚Ä¢	(%):-%N                Forces expansion in sourced/non-interactive contexts.
#	‚Ä¢	${this_script_path:A}:   Resolves the path to an absolute path (:A is the absolute path modifier).
#	‚Ä¢	${this_script_path:A:h}: Appends :h to get the directory (i.e., ‚Äúhead‚Äù ‚Äî the part before the final slash).
